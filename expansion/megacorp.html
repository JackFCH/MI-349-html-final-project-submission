          <h3>RELEASE DATE</h3>
          <p>MegaCorp is the third major expansion for Stellaris. It was announced on 2018-10-24. The expansion was accompanied by the free 2.2 patch (aka Le Guin).</p>
          <h3>EXPANSION FEATURES</h3>
          <ul>
             <li><p>Corporate Culture: CEOs of a MegaCorp can conduct business on a galaxy-wide scale with a host of new civics. By building Branch Offices on planets within empires they have trade agreements with, the MegaCorp can add a portion of the planet's Trade Value to their own network. Using the new Corporate Authority, construct an economic powerhouse and dominate galactic trade.</p></li>
             <li><p>City World: With Ecumenopolis, players can increase the population density of core worlds to truly epic proportions, eventually creating a planet-spanning megacity.</p></li>
             <li><p>Caravaneer Fleets: Keep an eye out for the Caravaneers, nomadic interstellar wheelers-and-dealers who stay aloof from galactic politics, and always have a bargain up their sleeve. Expect surprises when these master traders wander through your space or when you visit their home systems.</p></li>
             <li><p>More Megastructures: Build a glorious Matter Decompressor, Mega-Art Installation or Strategic Coordination Center to acquire new scaling capabilities for your megalopolis.</p></li>
             <li><p>Galactic Slave Market: Buy and sell pops on an industrial scale, set them free or keep them as livestock.</p></li>
             <li><p>New Ascension perks: Keep an economy competitive in a cutthroat galaxy with additional Ascension perks!</p></li>
           </ul>
