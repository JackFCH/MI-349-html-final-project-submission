           <h3>RELEASE DATE</h3>
           <p>Apocalypse is the second major expansion for Stellaris. It was announced on 2018-01-11 and its release date is 2018-02-22. The expansion is to be accompanied by the free 2.0 patch (aka Cherryh).</p>
           <h3>EXPANSION FEATURES</h3>
           <ul>
             <li><p>Planetary destruction – Ability to construct a special late-game planet-killer ship nicknamed "Colossus", a technological super-weapon that can, in one of its 6 configurations, shatter entire worlds.</p></li>
             <li><p>Titan class ships – Players are now capable of building strong capital-sized ships that offer tremendous bonuses to vessels under their command.</p></li>
             <li><p>Ion cannons – Starbases can deploy expensive defense modules that hit targets on the other side of the system with a powerful attack.</p></li>
             <li><p>Marauders – Nomadic empires can now spawn on the fringes of the galaxy and raid settled nations. Players can hire mercenary generals and admirals from them and order a raid on a rival if relations are high enough. There is also a chance these scattered hordes coalesce into a unified force, potentially triggering a mid-game crisis event.</p></li>
             <li><p>More civics and ascension perks to further customize the inter-stellar empires.</p></li>
      
           </ul>
